# Hi, I'm Lukas üëã
### An engineering student at The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

I am experienced in programming in Java, Python, C and JavaScript/TypeScript. I am also experienced with both front and backend development as well as SQL. 

## Projects
I have quite a few personal projects but some that I am extra proud of are:

| Project name                                                                       | Description                                                                                                                        |

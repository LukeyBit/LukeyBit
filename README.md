### Hi, I'm Lukas 👋
I'm a engineering student at The Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden.

- Hot take: JavaScript isn't that bad, especially with TypeScript 😅
- I'm currently learning C and MIPS Assembly 😨
- I'm currently working on a bunch of CompSci labs 🥵
- I would love to learn Rust 😍
- My editor of choice is Visual Studia Code but I'm trying to move to Neovim but it's taking me a minute 😂
- To contact me, hit me up on Reddit [![Reddit user LukeyBit](https://img.shields.io/badge/Follow%20me-Reddit-red?logo=reddit&logoColor=white)](https://www.reddit.com/user/LukeyBit)
